# Book.it!
> Discover old classics that Google has forgotten.

## Motivation
Sometimes, with a vague description, it is difficult to successfully find the title of an older book on Google. This is where Book.it! comes in. With a couple optimized algorithms and a database of over 15,000 titles that go way back into the 1800s, Book.it can find that one old classic you simply cannot find with your Google search.
